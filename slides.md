## Who we are

#### - RSEs in corpus and theoretical linguistics respectively, at the Dept. of German Studies and Linguistics, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany

## "Emergency" strategy for research projects that produce software but don't have access to a centralized RSE team, to make their software sustainable/re-usable



# Where we are now

### 1. New project = new person developing software 
<h3 class="fragment">2. ???</h3>

Note:
For every new research project (3 yrs. on average) there's a new person hired to develop software that enables or supports the project's research.


# Where we want to be

### 1. New project = new funding for work hours from a (centralized) RSE team
### 2. Sustainable/re-usable software

Note:
RSE team that will still be around when the project won't be, and takes care of the software

# Despair > strategy

#### - Create sustainable research software within project runtime
#### - Determine requirements for sustainable maintenance
#### - ... to be used in researcher training (Software Carpentry?)
#### - ... and practices recommendations for RSEs
#### - Create evidence for making a case for installation of RSE teams

Note:
Because we're still in the old, bad, situation, the only way out of despair is to devise a strategy.
We have funding from DFG for 3 years, classic setup



# Strategy

## More like "strategy": make do
### - Stick to best practices
### - Run project as an open source project
<br/>
## + Two building blocks


# Building blocks

### - Engineer software for re-usability (minimally)
### - Let infrastructure do the rest


# Engineer for re-usability

### 1. Use a generic data model
### 2. Make software extensible by design


# Infrastructure what infrastructure?

## - Use the free stuff that's there
## - Implement an actual maintenance role


# Minimal infrastructure components

## 1. Source Code Repo Platform
#### - Code, docs, issues, landing page

## 2. Release & Deposit Repo
#### - Zenodo

## 3. Dependencies Repo
#### - Ecosystem-dependent, e.g., Maven Central, PyPI, ...

## 4. Maintainer


## Maintainers, maintainers, maintainers, ...

### - Hire (and train!) a student
### - 10 hours / week should be enough in the long run
#### - integration, release and testing workflows
#### - communication with users and contributors
#### - manages, maintains, substitutes infrastructure components
#### - documents infrastructural decisions, builds, releases, maintainer changes, ... 



# Our case

### - Deep annotation of linguistic corpora
### - Morph architectural & functional prototype
### - Generic data model (generic graph)
### - Extensible (Eclipse RCP/OSGi)


# Infrastructure

### - GitHub
### - Zenodo
### - Maven Central, eclipse.org P2, P2 via GitHub


# Infrastructure sustainability

### - GitHub > Software Heritage (alt.: GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
### - Zenodo (long-term strategy)
### - Dependency repos: system-critical, foundation-funded, Software Heritage


# Maintainers

### - Predetermined breaking point
### - 4 maintainership changes during project


# Document all the things!



# What have we learned?

### - Minimal requirements for technically sustainable software
### - Minimal infrastructure for sustainable software development


# What will we have learned (ideally)?

#### - Sustainable, re-usable software
#### - Requirements for sustainable maintenance
#### - ... for researcher training
#### - ... for practices recommendations for RSEs

## - Evidence for making the case for RSE teams!
